### FIXED SETTINGS SECTION (rarely changed)
## default treshold 0 means everything is treaded as an anomaly/attack (it's just default number of allowed events of any kind)
# tresholds can be overwritten on both per-logfile level (in the RULEFILES file, see RULEFILES FILE FORMAT section for more info) and per-rule level (in the /etc/intrusive/rules/* files, see RULE FILES FORMAT section for more info)

treshold_overall_default=0
# excluded hosts are friednly IP-s, IF YOU'RE USING ENFORCING POLICY, IT'S VERY IMPORTANT to put here all friendly IP-addresses as you can, such as your public IP addresses, your local networks, servers you always connect to and so on, this will prevent Intrusive from blocking them with iptables if it detects attack/anomaly (alert is raised anyway)
